Signing Bonus is a web application built by Alex Todd, Kyle Eisenbarger, Tristan Mansfield, and Tyler Aden; Computer Science and Computer Information Systems students at Kansas State University.

Many companies have team building events or "fun committees" and these are some of the best ways to get involved in a company and meet fellow co-workers. The goal of Signing Bonus is to help students and new employees transition into the corporate world after graduation. We do this by providing a place for companies to post their upcoming events and other ways that employees can get involved.

Company managers can sign in to Signing Bonus, setup their company profile, and post upcoming events. Managers have the option to make events private to the company or public if they want to have attendees from around the local area.

When students sign in to Signing Bonus, we'll automatically connect them to the company and give them the list of upcoming events they can attend.
